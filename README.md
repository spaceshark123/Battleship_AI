# Battleship AI

This Java project acts as an AI helper for choosing the squares you attack in your Battleship games. Run the Main.java file and follow the instructions to win all of your Battleship games. When testing this project, I made several opponents rage-quit in frustration.

- Built-in standard battleship setup (Russian)
- customizable setups:
  - board size

  - number of each ship
